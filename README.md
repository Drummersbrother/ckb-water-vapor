# ckb-water-vapor
A small project to try out the ckb-daemon on linux, it might work on macOS, but I make `fib(0)` guarantees.
I only have a Corsair K70 RGB, and I only test on linux, so if you don't match both those things, I, once again, make `fib(0)` guarantees.
(oh, and the water vapour thing is a cloud :wink:)
